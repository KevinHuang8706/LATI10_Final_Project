        <h1>Reflection: Decolonial View of Cartel Narratives</h1>
        <p>Combining Aníbal Quijano’s analysis of enduring colonial power structures and Stuart Hall’s examination of discursive othering, this reflection explores how American media’s depiction of Latin American drug cartels reproduces racialized hierarchies, fuels exclusionary policies, and sustains a capitalist social order that benefits from fear and stereotypes (Quijano,2000,p.533–534; Hall,1996,p.225).
        </p>
        <p>
        By analyzing narconovelas, streaming dramas like Narcos, news reports, and political rhetoric, we see how cultural representations and institutional “truths” intertwine to marginalize Hispanic communities (McKenna,n.d.; Lara,2018; Brown,2025; Alvarez,2023).</p>
        <h2>Theories, Media, Politics, and Economics</h2>
        <p>
            In drawing on Quijano’s concept of the coloniality of power, we see that modern capitalism is built upon the racialized division of labor first instituted under European colonialism—assigning non-European peoples to unpaid or low-wage work while reserving dignified, high-paying roles for whites (Quijano, 2000, pp. 533–538). At the same time, Stuart Hall shows in The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power that discourse itself is a system through which power circulates—producing “truths” that shape how groups are perceived and governed (Hall,1996,p.225). From narconovelas to Narcos to 24-hour news, American media instigates the public into believing Hispanic communities as cartel suspects, reinforcing colonial labor hierarchies by suggesting that Latinos are naturally illicit and therefore should have no access to decent and legitimate employment, again pushing them to illicit economies. Political rhetoric and social media algorithms then leverage these stereotypes to justify increased policing, mass deportations, and policies that extract value from marginalized populations, showing how coloniality both creates and profits from the criminalization of an “other.”

        <h2>Paths to Decolonial Futures</h2>
        <p>
            Decolonial scholars emphasize that dismantling these intertwined economic and representational regimes requires building counter narrative and reclaiming cultural sovereignty: supporting local media, centering diverse voices, and challenging dominant “regimes of truth” (Hall, 1996, p. 269). Educational initiatives must incorporate critical lessons that exposes how discursive strategies operate to sustain social hierarchies (Hall, 1996, pp. 257–264). Policy makers should target the coloniality of labor by enforcing equitable labor rights, raising wages, and eliminating deportation practices rooted in racialized fear-mongering (Ward, 2025; Svirnovskiy, 2025). Only through coordinated cultural, economic, and political actions can the colonial power matrix be destroyed and true true equality be restored to Hispanic communities (Quijano, 2000, p. 574)
