        <h2>"Constructing" Domestic Gang</h2>
        <p>On the image on the left is the Mexica gang members as portrayed in the famous video game <em>GTA: San Andreas</em> from early 2000s. In this game, all Mexican gang members are pictured in this "East LA Gangbanger" stereotype: muscular, tank tops, bandanas, gang tatoos, and low-rider cars. In this game, this gang represents Hispanic criminal power who would go around prey on non-violent characters, mostly law-abiding, middle-class, and white Americans. In fact, there is no white gang in this game, while every other races has its own gang. As this game reaches millions and millions of young people across the world, these entertainment typecastings feed intp a broader narrative that can shape policy and prejudice.</p>
        <h2>Weaponizing Fear</h2>
        <p>
            Across the United States, the Trump administration and its allies have leaned on a “cartel narrative” to depict Latino immigrants as dangerous criminals in order to justify expansive deportation policies. In April, President Trump publicly labeled Kilmar Abrego García a violent MS-13 gang member—despite a federal judge’s order recognizing credible threats he would face persecution if removed—and proceeded with his deportation on the grounds of “public safety” (Ward, 2025). Senate Republicans and key DHS officials have echoed similar rhetoric, warning of a “cartel invasion” at the Southwest border and promising to “target criminals above all,” language that conflates asylum-seekers and long-standing community members with transnational criminal syndicates. Yet a recently declassified U.S. intelligence memo undercuts these claims, finding no evidence of cooperation between state actors and groups like Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua at the scale portrayed by administration spokespeople (Svirnovskiy, 2025). 
            By weaponizing fear of cartels, proponents have secured broad public support for increased ICE raids and expedited removals—even as critics decry the erosion of due process and the constitutional rights of immigrants.
