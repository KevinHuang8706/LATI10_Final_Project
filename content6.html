        <h1>Coloniality of Power</h1>

        <h2>Aníbal Quijano</h2>
        <p>
          Aníbal Quijano (17 November 1928 – 31 May 2018) was a Peruvian sociologist and humanist thinker,
          professor at the National University of San Marcos and later at Binghamton University in New York.
          Trained in sociology and deeply influenced by Marxist and subaltern studies, Quijano pioneered
          decolonial theory by demonstrating how European colonial hierarchies—particularly racial
          classifications and control over knowledge production—remain embedded in modern social, economic,
          and cultural systems long after formal decolonization.

        <h2>The Coloniality of Power in Cartel Narratives</h2>
        <p>
            Quijano’s coloniality framework reveals that the modern global order was built on a racialized division of labor that still bars Latinos from dignified, high-wage employment. From the moment of conquest, Europeans codified a “race” axis that assigned non-European peoples to non-waged or unwaged labor as a mark of inferiority (Quijano, 2000, p. 245). This new structure of labor control artfully combined all prior forms such as slavery and serfdom around the emerging logic of capital, ensuring that only Europeans accessed salaried work and independent trade. Colonized races, relegated to unpaid serfdom or chattel slavery, were considered unworthy of wages, a prejudice that persists in today’s wage gaps and biased hiring practices. Moreover, the geographic distribution of labor control cemented a center around Europeans and confined many Latinos to precarious, low-paid work. When legitimate pathways are obstructed by this enduring social geography, individuals are forced into informal or illicit economies, not out of inherent criminality, but as a survival response to the same colonial mechanisms that deny them full access to the formal labor market.

            Beyond producing barriers, coloniality also fuels and spreads the cartel narrative as a profitable cultural commodity. Quijano shows that all forms of labor control were deliberately articulated to serve capital and the world market, transforming every human activity into a potential source of profit. In Hispanic America, the Crown’s early decision to convert Indigenous peoples into serfs and confine Africans to slavery laid a blueprint for racialized labor hierarchies that equated non-European lives with exploitable resources. Today’s media operates within this same capitalist matrix and sensationalizes drug-related violence because racialized fear sells: cartel stories become global spectacles, monetizing both the image and the bodies of marginalized communities. This commodification creates a feedback loop—public fascination drives more coverage, deepening the association of Hispanic identity with criminality—and grants political actors a “regime of truth” that justifies militarized policing and mass deportations as necessary interventions. Thus, Coloniality of Power not only constructs the structural conditions that push Latinos toward illicit economies but also engineers the cultural and political demand that perpetuates and profits from their criminalization.
