        <h1>Cartel in Media</h1>
        <h2>Astounding Number</h2>
        <p>By summing up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category%3AFilms_about_the_illegal_drug_trade?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Wikipedia data</a>, across mainstream film and television, Hollywood has produced nearly 279 titles focused on the illegal drug trade—with 83 specifically about Mexican cartels and 22 about Colombian cartels—while Netflix’s dedicated “Drug Lords and Mob Bosses” genre alone features at least 16 distinct narco-themed shows and documentaries. 
            In the gaming world, Wikipedia catalogues 47 video games centered on drug-trafficking narratives (including a 13-entry subcategory for the Saints Row franchise), and user-curated lists such as IMDb’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls096480323/">“Best Drug Cartel Movies and TV Shows”</a> compile 34 top titles. Beyond mere counts, reports warn that increasing incorporation of drug trafficking elements in online video games, and critics express concern over the glorification of narco-violence and overused cliché of cartel warfares in interactive media. On social media side, narcoculture spreads through rap lyris, cartel members showing off wealth, and appropriating drug lord as respectable figures. So much so that when Ovidio Guzmán (El Chapo's son) was arrested in 2023.  On TikTok and Instagram, there was an eruption of posts – shockingly, many supportive of the young narco. Comments pleading “Let him go” trended in Spanish and English, as some youths treated Ovidio like a wronged celebrity (Alvarez, 2023).</p>

                <li><b>Drug Lord Idolization</b>: Young hispanic people come to believe that joining the cartel is the only way out of poverty. </li>
                <li><b>Misconception of Cartel Activities</b>: Dramalized depiction helps grow entertainment, tourism, and consumerism of narcoculture.</li>
                <li><b>And Many More ....</b></li>
